        <h1>Contacts Easy:Android App</h1>
	   <h4><p class="intro">This app takes photos using device's camera or can select photos from gallery.</p>
	    <p class="intro">It then recognises the phone numbers and name and saves to the contact list.</p></h4>

		Learning Part 
		</h3>

		
		<ul>
			<li> Completed a Beginner Level course on Android Development from udacity.com .</li>
			<li >Started an Intermediate level Android Development Course from udacity.com .</li>
			<li> Referred to Slidenerd(A Youtube Channel) to add particular features to our app.</li>
			
		</ul>
		<h3 >
		Development part  
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>Developed so far </h4>
			</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Developed apps as a part of course and for our project. </li>
				<li>As a part of course made apps i.e. coffee ordering app , basket ball score counter and some misc apps.</li>
				<li>An app which takes the name and contact number as a input and takes directy to the people app with name and number auto-filled.</li>
				<li>An app which ask user to choose/take a photo from gallery/camera and shows the selected photo on screen.</li>
				<li>Codes of the app can be view from the repository <a href="https://github.com/siddharth2610/test-apps.git"> Codes</a> </li>
			</ul>
			<li> <h4>Things to be Done.</h4></li>
			<ul>
				<li>A easy and Dynamic GUI.</li>
				<li>Saving contact without going Contact Manager  app</li>
				<li>Currently the camera which opens up is a default phone camera . I will modify the camera to make it simpler and increase the utility by giving a crop feature at the time of clicking photo.</li>
				<li>Once we achieve these things we try to add more features.<h3> Suggestions are heartedly welcomed.!</h3></li>

<h1 class="head1">Image Processing and OCR</h1>
			<h2>Team mates working on it:Mukul,Apurv,Romal</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>learned image processing using opencv</li>
			<li>read many algorithms on image noise cancellation, skew correction and characterrecognition</li>
			<li>learned how to use opencv library functions like inread, inshow,morphology,erode-dilate etc</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Algorithms and Strategies for OCR</h2>
			<ul>
			  <li>labelling adjacent pixels of a character with same value</li>
			  <li>preprocessing the image to reduce noise.</li>
			  <li>skew angle detection,skew corrections.</li>
			  <li>store pixel value of each character and create boundary</li>
			  <li>match character from test data form words</li>
			  <li>new algorithm for ocr as earlier was not working properly</li>
			</ul>
